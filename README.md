# APB Protocol Implementation and Testbench

## Overview
This project implements an Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) protocol system, including an APB master, two APB slaves, and a top module integrating them. The system is designed according to the AMBA APB specification, supporting read and write operations with error handling and slave selection based on address decoding. A comprehensive testbench is provided to validate the system's functionality through various test cases.

The design is written in Verilog and includes a testbench to simulate and verify the APB protocol operations, such as basic read/write, address decoding, wait states, error handling, burst transfers, and randomized transactions.

## Files
- `APB_master.v`: Implements the APB master module, responsible for initiating read and write transactions, controlling the bus, and handling slave responses.
- `APB_slave.v`: Implements the APB slave module, which responds to read and write requests, manages a 256-byte memory, and generates error signals for invalid addresses.
- `APB_top.v`: Integrates the APB master with two APB slaves, connecting them via the necessary signals and handling slave selection.
- `APB_tb.v`: A testbench that verifies the functionality of the APB system through a series of test cases, including basic operations, error handling, and stress testing.

## Test Cases

The testbench (`APB_tb.v`) includes the following test cases to verify the functionality of the APB system:

### Basic Write Operation (TC1)
- **Description**: Tests a write transaction with no wait states.
- **Inputs**: `transfer = 1`, `write = 1`, `read = 0`, valid `apb_write_paddr`, valid `apb_write_data`.
- **Expected Output**: Slave receives correct address and data, `pready` is asserted after one clock cycle, and data is written to the correct memory location.
- **Test**: Writes data `8'hAA` to address `9'h005`.

### Basic Read Operation (TC2)
- **Description**: Tests a read transaction with no wait states.
- **Inputs**: `transfer = 1`, `write = 0`, `read = 1`, valid `apb_read_paddr`.
- **Expected Output**: Slave returns correct data via `prdata`, `apb_read_data_out` contains expected data, `pready` is asserted after one clock cycle.
- **Test**: Reads data from address `9'h005`.

### Address Decoding (Slave Selection) (TC3)
- **Description**: Validates that the master correctly selects the appropriate slave based on the address range.
- **Inputs**: Test addresses for Slave 1 (`9'h005`, `psel1 = 1`, `psel2 = 0`) and Slave 2 (`9'h085`, `psel1 = 0`, `psel2 = 1`).
- **Expected Output**: Only the correct slave is selected, and the other remains idle.
- **Test**: Writes `8'hA5` to `9'h005` (Slave 1) and `8'h5A` to `9'h085` (Slave 2).

### Write with Wait States (TC4)
- **Description**: Tests a write transaction where the slave introduces wait states.
- **Inputs**: Slave delays asserting `pready`.
- **Expected Output**: Master remains in the ENABLE state until `pready` is asserted, and data is written only when the transfer completes.
- **Test**: Writes `8'hBB` to `9'h010` with a simulated wait state.

### Read with Wait States (TC5)
- **Description**: Tests a read transaction where the slave introduces wait states.
- **Inputs**: Slave delays asserting `pready`.
- **Expected Output**: Master remains in the ENABLE state until `pready` is asserted, and correct data is captured when the transfer completes.
- **Test**: Reads from `9'h010` with a simulated wait state.

### Error Handling (PSLVERR) (TC6)
- **Description**: Tests error conditions during a write operation with an invalid address.
- **Inputs**: Invalid address (`9'h1FF`), `write = 1`, `read = 0`.
- **Expected Output**: Slave asserts `pslverr`, and the master captures the error condition.
- **Test**: Attempts to write `8'hFF` to `9'h1FF`.

### Burst of Transfers (TC7)
- **Description**: Tests multiple back-to-back read and write transfers.
- **Inputs**: Alternate read and write transactions without returning to IDLE.
- **Expected Output**: Master and slaves handle consecutive transfers correctly, with proper `psel` and `penable` transitions.
- **Test**: Performs write and read operations on addresses `9'h001`, `9'h002`, and `9'h003`.

### Out-of-Range Address (TC8)
- **Description**: Tests system behavior with an address outside the valid range of the slaves.
- **Inputs**: Invalid address (`9'h1FF`).
- **Expected Output**: Slave asserts `pslverr`, and the master detects the error.
- **Test**: Attempts to write `8'hFF` to `9'h1FF`.

### Reset Behavior (TC9)
- **Description**: Tests the reset functionality of the system.
- **Inputs**: Assert `presetn` (active-low reset).
- **Expected Output**: All signals return to their default states, and no transfers occur during reset.
- **Test**: Applies reset for 20 ns and verifies default states.

### Randomized Transactions (TC10)
- **Description**: Stress-tests the system with randomized read and write operations.
- **Inputs**: Randomly generated `read`, `write`, `apb_write_paddr`, `apb_read_paddr`, and `apb_write_data`.
- **Expected Output**: System remains stable and handles transactions correctly.
- **Test**: Executes 20 randomized read and write transactions.
